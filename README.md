# Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry with Python

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project consists of assignments and practical exercises related to **Linear Algebra** and **Analytic Geometry** solved using Python. The repository includes both the theoretical foundations required for understanding the concepts and the Python code used to implement them. The project was developed as part of a university course on **Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry**.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
The project includes solutions to various problems in the following areas:
- **Linear Algebra**:
  - Vectors and vector spaces
  - Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, inversion)
  - Determinants and eigenvalues/eigenvectors
  - Solving systems of linear equations
- **Analytic Geometry**:
  - Lines and planes in 2D and 3D space
  - Conic sections (circles, ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas)
  - Transformation matrices and rotations
  - Distance, angles, and projections in geometry
